# Algorithms in C
The learning of the widely diverse, important and useful methods for solving problems(algorithms)
using the C programming language.

## 1. Euclid's Algorithm:
* An efficient way of finding the highest common Factor.

## 2. Gray Code:
* A very useful way to minimize errors during data transfers

## 3. Minimum Substring:
* Can be very useful in applications where we need to find a substring that contains a certain set of characters

## 4. FizzBuzz:
* A very useful program demonstrating importance of being able to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## 5. ABC Problem:
* Presents a clear illustration of a problem-solving task centered around data manipulation.

## 6. Balanced Bracket Algorithm:
* Common application of this algo is in programming language compilers and interpreters. Brackets are used to delimit blocks of code.

## 7. Circles of Given Radius Through Two Points:
* The Find Circles algorithm can be useful in various fields that involve geometry, such as engineering, architecture, and physics.
For example, can be used to calculate the size of a gear needed to transmit motion between two gears.

## 8. 100 Doors:
* This algorithm helps in developing critical thinking skills and logical reasoning, which can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems.

## 9. Date manipulation:
* This algorithm can be useful in a lot of different industries and situations where date and time calculations are important.

## 10. String Formatting Algorithm:
* This algorithm can be used to generate a user friendly, grammatically correct message based on the number of items in a list

## 11. String Searching Algorithm:
* The ability to count non-overlapping occurences of a substring in a string is a powerful tool that can be used in a wide variety of real-world scenarios to search, analyze, and extract information from text data.

## 12. Count the Coins:
* This algorithm for counting the number of ways to make change using common US coins has several real-world applications.

## 13. Two Sum Problem:
* This algorithm can be used as a starting point for solving more complex problems, and as a building block in many other algorithms.

## 14. Missing Number in Array:
* This algorithm can be very useful while performing calculations or generating reports in the context of data analysis. Since the algorithm can be used to find missing values in datasets and to perform calculations accordingly.

## 15. Kadane Algorithm:
* This algorithm can be used in many real-world situations. Including machine learning for feature selection, where it is used to find the most important features in a dataset.

## 16. Arranging an array of 0s, 1s and 2s:
* This is an important algorithm as it has many real-world applications. For example, in computer networks, datum is often represented in binary form. TCP and IP are network protocols where sorting an array of 0s and 1s is imperative.
