# Algorithms in C
The learning of the widely diverse, important and useful methods for solving problems(algorithms)
using the C programming language.

## 1. Euclid's Algorithm:
* An efficient way of finding the highest common Factor.

## 2. Gray Code:
* A very useful way to minimize errors during data transfers

## 3. Minimum Substring:
* Can be very useful in applications where we need to find a substring that contains a certain set of characters

## 4. FizzBuzz:
* A very useful program demonstrating importance of being able to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## 5. ABC Problem:
* Presents a clear illustration of a problem-solving task centered around data manipulation.

## 6. Balanced Bracket Algorithm:
* Common application of this algo is in programming language compilers and interpreters. Brackets are used to delimit blocks of code.

## 7. Circles of Given Radius Through Two Points:
* The Find Circles algorithm can be useful in various fields that involve geometry, such as engineering, architecture, and physics.
For example, can be used to calculate the size of a gear needed to transmit motion between two gears.
